# Detection-of-Cancer-Cells-of-various-types-using-ML-and-Photonic-Crystal-base-sensor
Goal of the project is to build a system which will detect cancer cells. Build a photonic crystal-based system which will detect cancer cell using ML Algorithm. Helps in detection of cancerous cell in early stage. Providing faster results in real world application.
